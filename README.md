'unified_data.csv' contains data of all files (Task 1).

There are two png images just as you enter repository, those contain images to check if the numbers 
follow this vertical hierarchy. (Task 2, for my analysis please check out the notebook file).

All the folders contain images and csv files (these contain raw metrics and not the mean values that have
been shown in the plots) regarding health trends. (Task 3)

All my analysis is in the notebook itself rather than in a word or pdf file.

Note : Please remember to change file paths when running the code, and also you might encounter warnings when 
       you read the data you gave me for analysis (as at least some of the files contain hidden columns).
